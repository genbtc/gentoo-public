Ideas: 

Portage on the web
Portage Binhost Daemon
Portage Server/Client API

ask Portage whats installed
ask portage how to resolve deps
ask portage what binpkgs it can fulfill
queue portage jobs remotely
build packages remotely
SPEC FILE for building.
spec.json:
    {
        "arch": "v2",
        "CFLAGS": "-O2 -pipe",
        "make.confVAR1": "1",
        "make.confVAR2": "2"
    }
portage_execute_command: emerge --buildpkgonly --remote 192.168.2.2 <pkgname>

make it work like distCC except not in src_compile, just pkg_fetch and pkg_install

Portage OSTree .

one thing I think that would be helpful is to convert Public concepts into gentooisms lingo and then into some python api code, or CLI one-liner.

package queriers: equery, q*, portageq, eix, gentoopm now

equery + portageq + gentoopm are python, eix/q = C
