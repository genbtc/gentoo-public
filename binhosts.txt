Portage Binhosts
--------------------

prefer defaults, including FEATURES="binpkg-multi-instance" 
, file extension will be .xpak (not .tbz2)
but need to compile binpkg with FEATURES="buildpkg"

default dir goes to PKGDIR=/var/cache/binpkgs
 (need to collect them all from there periodically and move them, rsync)

example rsyncd.conf:
use chroot = yes
[binhostA]
    path = /mnt/RaidZ-4TBx4/DiskImages/LinuxDD/./binpkgs-gentoo-atom-tablet-1/
    read only
[binhostB]
    path = /mnt/RaidZ-4TBx4/DiskImages/LinuxDD/./binpkgs-second-one-2/
    read only

GPG Signing goes above and beyond, that is documented elsewhere, check gentoo wiki.
