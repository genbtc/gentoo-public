Containers are cool and all, but the premise of corporate-controlled-container-bundles is a non-starter for me. Slippery Slope, Bait and Switch. These lazy Redhat+Canonical container bundles for everything is like mandatory forced compliance. Makes no sense for forks or for custom setups. They want the container because it can enforce a monoculture, and it can also ship anti-features that cannot be decoupled. If you don't agree, I have 10 other points to raise. If you don't get it, be thankful, some crazy Gentoo'ers are out there keeping software build freedom alive despite this.

Praise to Gentoo. It acts as a giant fuzzer for bad packages and Gentoo finds and sometimes fixes upstreams build problems faster than they can - as far as active bug reports!
Personally speaking, Containers are cool and all, but the premise of corporate-controlled-container-bundles is a non-starter for me. Slippery Slope, Bait and Switch. I know most people don't realize all the benefits of Gentoo, but we are compatible with many alternative libraries, we even know Firefox build system enough to un-bundle some of the upstream vendor'ed libs and replace them. Sure LibreOffice sucked to build, but we did it. We can replace glibc with musl, or systemd with openrc or runit or s6. gcc can be replaced by LLVM/clang. ncurses can be replaced. We don't do this because it was easy, we do it because it is hard. Everyone can reap the benefits of extreme hard work.
These lazy Redhat+Canonical container bundles for everything is like mandatory forced compliance. Sure Fedora was already like that but Gentoo will never go lockstep with the Borg. It also makes no sense for forks or for custom setups. They want the container because it can enforce a monoculture, and it can also ship anti-features that cannot be decoupled. If you don't agree, I have 10 other points to raise. If you don't get it, be thankful, some crazy Gentoo'ers are keeping software build freedom alive.
