Interesting lines of thought:

Gentoo Binpkgs ->  BinPKG repo -> (dilfridge)
Considerations: 
 Multiple dirs, One per Chroot in storage pool
 Multiple profiles, per configroot, allow select one or multiple
  select profile -> chroot -> emerge world -> binpkg
 different dates, sort into batches for quarterly release
 always renegerate at least once per quarter.
 bundle release into rootfs squashfs, xz, and symlinks to the binpkgs (ala Nix)
try and rebuild twice to find out if package is the same checksum
=
Reproducible Builds
blockers = timestamp. SOURCE_EPOCH_TIME

tips = bootstrappable.com has simple bash scripts to wget external files & checksums
