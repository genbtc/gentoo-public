Portage Binhosts
--------------------
To create a binhost:

prefer defaults, including FEATURES="binpkg-multi-instance" 
, file extension will be .xpak (not .tbz2)
first step, set FEATURES="buildpkg" in make.conf, and recompile binpkgs, maybe emerge -e @world

default dir goes to PKGDIR=/var/cache/binpkgs
At this point your client machine has generated packages for itself.
They do not serve though.
 (need to collect them all from there periodically and move them to a dir they can be served from)

for the sake of example, you can turn your client into a basic server
and serve it right out of the PKGDIR
# /var/cache/binpkgs # python -m http.server 8080
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8080 (http://0.0.0.0:8080/) ...

or, first use rsync as a client, rsync -rtlv $PKGDIR $remoteB/storage)
Then set up rsyncd (rsync server) to use custom directory trees

#example rsyncd.conf, uses rsync as a server:
use chroot = yes
[binhostA]
    path = /storage/./binpkgs-gentoo-atom-tablet-1/
    read only
[binhostB]
    path = /storage/./binpkgs-second-one-2/
    read only

Then set up 
#/etc/portage/binrepos.conf - on the client:
[binhost1]
sync-uri = rsync://10.1.1.1/binhost1
[binhost2]
sync-uri = rsync://10.1.1.1/binhost2

# to regenerate Packages index file
# emaint binhost --fix
NOTE:- currently doesnt work on $target_dir , requires a patch to write file elsewhere.
     - see my patch @ patches/portage-binhost-py.patch
#https://github.com/genbtc/gentoo-public/blob/main/binhost/portage-binhost-py.patch
note:(also, it pulls some stats from the running profile and full system configs)
(when you re-generate, the top system header fields will be mismatched, namely the name of the profile)

GPG Signing .gpkg - goes above and beyond,,, that is documented elsewhere, check gentoo wiki.

To be continued. Later.
