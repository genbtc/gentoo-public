This commit is where they changed pyrsistent to rpds - Mar 6 2023

(pmap to HashTrieMap)
(at the time using jsonschema-specifications v 2023.03.1 , and version number was unchanged) (a new 3.6 version came out later that day)
where "pyrsistent>=0.19.3"  became "rpds-py>=0.4.1"
goal is revert this patch entirely, but -R wont apply cleanly

manual Revert works.
Requires patching jsonschema and forking the ebuilds of jsonschema-specifications and referencing

1 patch with 3 files to jsonschema. ( test case test_cli.py is also affected but optional. test may be fake to begin with)
#jsonschema/validator.py
#jsonschema/_types.py

dev-python/referencing
#This is a main issue too
v0.29.3 has been changed to rust rpds also, there were big changes here.
reverting to v0.23.0 solves this entirely. v0.24.0 is documented in the changelog as when it switched to rpds
This has been the version chosen to base the new forked ebuilds on.
(this package has chosen >=pyrsistent 0.19.3 (current as of now) for DEPEND too)

dev-python/jsonschema-specifications
quickChange jsonschema ebuild to 4.17.3 ish with a 4.18.6 name (old one matches better than the new 4.19.1 one)
# 1 diff in the ebuild between json-spec 03.6 and json-spec-07.1 - 03.6 one was never in our gentoo tree, earliest we had is 05.2
