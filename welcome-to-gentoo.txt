# 2023 genr8eofl - welcome to gentoo

welcome to gentoo!

the package manager is named portage, but the main command is emerge
man emerge
man portage
-
emerge common options:
-a --ask
-p --pretend
-v --verbose
-t --tree (visual)
-1 --oneshot
-n --noreplace (--selective=n)
-u --update (--selective=y)
-D --deep (deep is deeper than --complete-graph)
-U --changed-use (rebuild)
-N --newuse      (rebuild)
-c --depclean (remove package if possible)
-C --unmerge (force remove)
--rage-clean (unmerge with CLEAN_DELAY=0)
--exclude
--backtrack=30 or 999 for extreme luck


to Maintain package.use, package.accept_keywords w/ periodic maintenance:
enalyze
echo $(emerge -epvO @world) >> somefile/do it manually

Interact, query with package databases:
eix
portageq
portage-utils (q)
equery (gentoolkit)
gentoopm (python)

portconf::guru
 portconf -cpu #current profile use flags, works
 portconf -apu all profiles use flags does not work, must set PORTDIR=/var/db/repos/gentoo portconf, then it works.
 # patch for this available in /etc/portage/patches/

emaint
usage: usage: emaint [options] COMMAND
The emaint program provides an interface to system health checks and maintenance.
See the emaint(1) man page for additional information about the following commands:
Commands:
  all            Perform all supported commands
  binhost        Scan and generate metadata indexes for binary packages.
  cleanconfmem   Check and clean the config tracker list for uninstalled packages.
  cleanresume    Discard emerge --resume merge lists
  logs           Check and clean old logs in the PORTAGE_LOGDIR.
  merges         Scan for failed merges and fix them.
  movebin        Perform package move updates for binary packages
  moveinst       Perform package move updates for installed and binary packages.
  sync           Check repos.conf settings and sync repositories.
  world          Check and fix problems in the world file.


Editing Make.conf:

#push for weekly updates at least
PORTAGE_SYNC_STALE="7"

#(Logger: ElogV)
app-portage/elogv can be used to read elogs.
put this in make.conf to enable elogging:
-COMMON_FLAGS=
PORTAGE_LOGDIR="/var/cache/buildlogs"
PORTAGE_ELOG_CLASSES="${PORTAGE_ELOG_CLASSES} info"
PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM="${PORTAGE_ELOG_SYSTEM} save"

app-portage/cpuid2cpuflags
CPU_FLAGS_X86="aes avx avx2 f16c fma3 mmx mmxext pclmul popcnt rdrand sha sse sse2 sse3 sse4_1 sse4_2 sse4a ssse3"
these change more between machines generations, you might want to settle on a simpler single common denominator

optionally: app-misc/resolve-march-native
-march=znver3 -mshstk --param=l1-cache-line-size=64 --param=l1-cache-size=32 --param=l2-cache-size=512
put it in COMMON_FLAGS, the cache params are optional
otherwise just feel free to use -march=native 

You can tweak make's thread parameter for your CPU and RAM usage. I have more than enough myself.
Usually its 2GB of ram per GCC thread max, so you might need swap.
Stick to lowering the threads if you are running out of memory (OOM)
#MAKE MULTI-THREADED N+2, cap at N+1 load average
MAKEOPTS="-j18 -l17"

#Nice
PORTAGE_SCHEDULING_POLICY="idle"
PORTAGE_NICENESS=19

This enables pretty colors in the compile spam as much as possible
#Super-Ultra-Mega-Force Colors on: (by sam_)
CLICOLOR_FORCE=1
CMAKE_COLOR_DIAGNOSTICS=ON
CMAKE_COMPILER_COLOR_DIAGNOSTICS=ON

You want to be building the packages you compile as backups so you have easy times swapping in/out packages without recompiling
I advise everyone use this even if they think they wont need it, you can always clear them out when they fill up.
#PKGDIR="/var/cache/binpkgs"
#(bin packages: build & get)
FEATURES="${FEATURES} buildpkg"

Note: you can regenerate the /var/cache/binpkgs/Packages index file with the 
'emaint binhost --fix' command

#optional,advanced:
if you want to use a remote binhost, you need this in make.conf and 
#FEATURES="${FEATURES} getbinpkg"
and something like this in /etc/portage/binrepos.conf
[binhost1]
sync-uri = rsync://10.1.1.1/binhost1
which in my case pointed to an rsyncd server on the remote.

you can also use the command line (example):
export PORTAGE_BINHOST="rsync://10.1.1.1/binhost1 rsync://10.1.1.2:2222/binhost2"

#WARNING Advanced Feature, "suidctl" whitelist at /etc/portage/suidctl.conf 
#FEATURES="${FEATURES} suidctl"
Prevent rogue setuid (suid) +s binaries from being installed at the highest root privelege level by portage.
NOTE: can break some programs functionality until you manually whitelist them, remember this.

#optional,advanced:
prevent locales from clogging up disk
INSTALL_MASK="/usr/share/locale"

#common EMERGE SETTINGS ( -avtU)
EMERGE_DEFAULT_OPTS="--ask --verbose --tree --changed-use --keep-going \
--autounmask=y --autounmask-write=y --autounmask-use=y \
--binpkg-respect-use=y --binpkg-changed-deps=y --with-bdeps=y"

-
Cron should be installed and scripts made.
prefer something like cronie
Syslog should be installed
possibly use rsyslog and logrotate
Auditd should be installed
