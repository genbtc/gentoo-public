binhosts
+
portage - client/server
=
DISTCCBINHOST

normal way:
FEATURES="buildpkg"
files ending in .xpak's(.tbz2 + metadata) are created unless GPKG signing is turned on then its .gpkg
default is $PKGDIR:=/var/cache/binpkgs
local index: /var/cache/binpkgs/Packages

cd /var/cache/binpkgs
ls Packages
emaint binhost --check

python -m http.server 8008

is enough to serve a binhost

export PORTAGE_BINHOST="http://127.0.0.1:8008"
and
emerge -g @world option will pull the binhost and update it.
the process downloads the Packages file from the remote host and stores it locally @  
remote index: /var/cache/edb/binhost/${REMOTEHOSTNAME}/Packages

sometimes you need to clear your local cache if you do too many updates, the other end doesnt notice.
rm -rf /var/cache/edb/binhost/*/

sometimes the binhost gets cranky about USE flags or deps not matching, theres two flags for emerge:
--binpkg-respect-use=y
--binpkg-changed-deps=y
this will force it to happen

the emerge -G option will try to force it to use binpkgs only (local + remote)
